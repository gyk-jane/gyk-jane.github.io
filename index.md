## Welcome to my page.
### Take a look at my projects!

for the topics below, include github source link and github page link.  
<br/>

#### data science
* [Color and music project](color-project)
> A visual representation of music and an auditory representation of color and other things lmfao  
> want to implement ML to create better sounding music from the painting -> music conversion.
> for instance, van gogh listened primarly to this one artist whose name escapes me. i wonder what a sound produced from van gogh's painting would sound like if the rhythmic pattterns the producer's songs were applied to van gogh's paintings?
> also want basic analysis. what colors represent debussy's songs versus beethoven's? what colors represent blues music? what colors baroque music?, etc.

* [Music ML]()
> Generate nujabe's-like music by feeding the model all of nujabes' songs
> Do it for other beats/instrumentalist artists i like - bill evans, the artist behind sunset, debussy
> so the genres we have are lo-fi, jazz, techno, and impressionist (i think - or is it romantic?)

* [ML in economics]()
> Have no idea. Idea generation still in progress.

* [more "practical" projects]()
> But i still have to find the ideas interesting.

#### game dev

* [crazy arcade]()
> completely inspired by the game crazy arcade. a recreation of the game because i wanted to play it for so long with friends but couldnt. need to find a way to make it multiplayer, though.

<br/>
<br/>

#### apps

* [youtube music desktop]()
> because i absolutely despise the UI of ytm. the current "desktop" version isn't even desktop since its connected to the chrome browser. also the media controls don't even work so i want to try to make a work around.
